## Project Overview

The FitLife platform comprises several key features:

1. **User Registration and Login:**
   - Users can register by providing basic personal information such as name, surname, date of birth, gender, email address, phone number, and profile photo.
   - Users can log in using their email and securely stored password. Authentication processes should be implemented.
   - A "forgot password" option is available for users to reset their passwords.

2. **User Profiles:**
   - Users can edit their personal profile pages, add profile pictures, and update basic information.

3. **User Roles:**
   - The application has three user roles: Admin, Trainer, and Trainee.
   - Admins have comprehensive access rights for general application management, including managing user accounts and data.
   - Trainers can edit their profile information, access information about assigned trainees, create and update exercise programs, and create and update nutrition plans.
   - Trainees can view and edit their profiles, access exercise and nutrition plans, communicate with trainers, add and manage progress records, and view visual reports.

4. **Trainer Profiles:**
   - Trainers can edit their profile information, including name, surname, specialization areas (weight gain, weight loss, weight maintenance, muscle gain), experiences, and contact details.

5. **Trainer-Trainee Relationship:**
   - After trainees enter their personal information and goals, the system will systematically match trainers based on their expertise and the number of trainees they can handle.
   - Each trainer can have a maximum of 5 trainees.

6. **Database Design:**
   - Utilize a cloud-based relational database service
   - Design tables such as 'User,' 'Trainer,' 'Workout Programs,' 'Nutrition Plans,' 'Messaging,' and 'User-Trainer Relationship.'
   - Establish relationships between tables using keys, ensuring normalization.
